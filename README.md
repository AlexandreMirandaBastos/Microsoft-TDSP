This repository contains the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP) from Microsoft**. 
TDSP is an agile, iterative, data science process for executing and delivering advanced analytics solutions. It is designed to to improve collaboration and efficiency of data science teams in enterprise organizations. It is supported through the following components:
- a lifecycle that defines the steps in project development
- a standardized project structure
- project scoping and reporting document and artifact templates
- tools to assist with data science tasks

### Contributing to TDSP

We believe that with the help of the data science community, we can make TDSP even better, and can benefit more enterprises and individual data scientists to be more efficient. We welcome contributions to TDSP, either on documentation or on workflow or implementing TDSP on different tools for versioning or work items management. Feel free to contribute pages at [TDSP/wiki](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/wiki). 

If you have some useful data science tools and utilities to share, we encourage you to contribute to
