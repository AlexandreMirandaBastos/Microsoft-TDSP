This repository contains the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP) from Microsoft**. 
TDSP is an agile, iterative, data science process for executing and delivering advanced analytics solutions. It is designed to to improve collaboration and efficiency of data science teams in enterprise organizations. It is supported through four key components:
- a lifecycle that defines the steps in project development
- a standardized project template, including structure, scoping and reporting documents
- tools to assist with data science project tasks (e.g. version control,  data exploration and modeling, work planning)
- distributed resources for project execution (e.g. version control, and cloud compute and storage resources)

For execution of data science projects, TDSP provides guidelines on how to [**structure collaborative teams and tasks**](Docs/roles-tasks.md) for data science projects, and [**execute data science projects using Agile planning and version control**](Docs/project-execution.md).

To perform certain stages of a data science project efficiently, we also provide [**data exploration and (semi)automated modeling tools in R and Python**](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities).


## Release Notes

This is version 0.1.2 of TDSP. Version 0.1.1 was released in September 2016. We are continuously improving TDSP based on our further accumulated experience, and customer feedback. 

## Ask Questions 

Should you have any questions or suggestions, please create a new discussion thread on the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/issues).

## Contributing to TDSP

We believe that with the help of the data science community, we can make TDSP even better, and can benefit more enterprises and individual data scientists to be more efficient. We welcome contributions to TDSP, either on documentation or on workflow or implementing TDSP on different tools for versioning or work items management. Feel free to contribute pages at [TDSP/wiki](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/wiki). 

If you have some useful data science tools and utilities to share, we encourage you to contribute to 
the [TDSP-Utilities Github repository](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities).
