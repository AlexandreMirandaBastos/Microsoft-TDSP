This repository contains the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP) from Microsoft**. 
TDSP is an agile, iterative, data science process for executing and delivering advanced analytics solutions. It is designed to to improve collaboration and efficiency of data science teams. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, documentation and artifact templates, and tools for executing data science projects. 

## Release Notes

This is an **early preview** release of TDSP. We are continuously improving TDSP based on our further accumulated experience, and customer feedback. Stay tuned for future releases. 

## Ask Questions. 

We would love to hear back from you. Should you have any questions or suggestions, please create a new discussion thread on the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/issues).

## Make TDSP Better, Together

We believe that with the help of the data science community, we can make TDSP even better, and can benefit more enterprises and individual data scientists to be more efficient. We welcome contributions to TDSP, either on documentation or on workflow or implementing TDSP on different tools for versioning or work items management. Feel free to contribute pages at [TDSP/wiki](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/wiki). 

If you have some useful data science utilities to share, we encourage you to contribute to 
the [TDSP-Utilities Github repository](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities).
